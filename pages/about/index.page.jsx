          <p>
            Myself Pushpendra Singh, Iâ€™m a Full Stack Developer based in
            Bangalore, India. I have passion for intuitive web and mobile
            design.I love developing applications and solution which tend to
            solve problems. I am also big time sucker for design and
            illustration, when I am free I like to do some graphic design work.
            If I find an amazing color palette or font, I have to build an app
            or website using them, because of this I have many unfinished side
            projects.
